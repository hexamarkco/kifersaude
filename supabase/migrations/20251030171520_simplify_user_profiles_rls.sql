/*
  # Simplify user_profiles RLS to prevent recursion

  1. Problem
    - current_user_role() function still causes issues
    - Loading infinitely because of RLS errors

  2. Solution
    - Drop the helper function approach
    - Use simple policies that don't query user_profiles
    - Store role in JWT metadata for admin checks

  3. Security
    - Users can only see/insert their own profile
    - Admins identified by app_metadata in JWT

-- This is safe because sensitive data should be in auth.users, not user_profiles

-- Only allow updates and deletes through service role or specific user
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
